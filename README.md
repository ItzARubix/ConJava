# ConJava
A collection of simple static methods for Java. 

**ConJava** is a very simple collection of Java methods designed to increase project speed by implementing the methods that you _could_ program, but would really rather not. 

Many of the methods present in **ConJava** are "School Assignment" style methods that perform a simple task like reversing or sorting a data structure. These methods are quick to program, but are numerous enough that it is convenient to have them all in one place for anyone to quickly implement and use. This also makes **ConJava** a great project to contribute to, as anyone with a little spare time can add a method that they think would be useful. 

All of the methods in **ConJava** are static. This means that you don't have to worry about creating instances of **ConJava** and keeping track of memory. Just run the methods that you need to use! 

As of right now, **ConJava** is not a package, both because it is unfinished and because its utility as a package would not be realized. Until more methods are added to the **ConJava** project (or the direction of **ConJava** is more fully determined) it will thusly remain as a simple project.
