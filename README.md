# JavaArtifacts
A lightweight, multipurpose, Java package (that is currently under construction).

**JavaArtifacts** is a very simple Java package designed to increase project speed by implementing the methods that you _could_ program, but would really rather not. 

As of now, the only present file in this package is just called **Artifacts**, which is also still thusly unfinished.

## Artifacts

Many of the methods present in **Artifacts** are "School Assignment" style methods that perform a simple task like reversing or sorting a data structure. These methods are quick to program, but are numerous enough that it is convenient to have them all in one place, in a single package, for anyone to quickly implement and use. This also makes **Artifacts** a great project to contribute to, as anyone with a little spare time can add a method that they think would be useful. 

All of the methods in **Artifacts** are static, allowing for a little more functional flavor within your object oriented Java programs. This means that you don't have to worry about creating instances of **Artifacts** and keeping track of memory. Just run the methods that you need to use!

I'll write a better explanation later hopefully lol.
